# Prognosis-and-Classification-Project
 
This is a small project realized by me within my second year of faculty.

# Overview
   
     - Introduce the dataset (#1) 
     
     - Count & Classification (#2) 
     
     - Classifying data by attributes: manual plotting - a sort of clustering (#3) 
     
     - Automated plotting: random plotting (#4) 
     
     - Liniar regression and a sort of clustering (#5)
     
# Tools
   - Anaconda - Jupyter Notebook as IDE
   
     
# CSV - Dataset
 Dataset's documentation can be found here:

# Sources for another topics ( Neural Network )

 I feel to mention some learning-sources that have been very useful for me, even though they are bind to topics that are not present in this presentation:
 
  Neural Network :
